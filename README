Description
===========

RILogo is a command line program to create an RNA-RNA interaction logo from a
pair of RNA sequences or alignments. If alignments are given as input, then
RILogo displays them as sequence logos. Intramolecular base pairs are displayed
by arcs connecting the corresponding columns of the sequence logo.
Intermolecular base pairs are denoted by connecting lines between both logos.

RILogo calculates the mutual information for base pairs and displays it through
a color gradient in the arcs and the lines. Additionally an 'M' character is
placed in the sequences logos.

Availability
============

The source code of RILogo is available at http://github.com/pmenzel/RILogo
To fetch a copy: git clone git://github.com/pmenzel/RILogo.git 


Installation
============

RILogo is written in C++ for Linux. It does not depend on
additional libraries.  To compile from source, simply type "make" and the
program will be compiled into the binary file "RILogo".


Usage
=====

RILogo expects either one or two input files that contain the sequences as
arguments, or can read a single input file from STDIN.

$ ./RILogo [options] file1.fa [file2.fa]  >output.svg

or 

$ ./RILogo [options] <file.fa >output.svg


Input format
============

The input is either a single file or two files in FASTA alignment format
In the former case, the sequences of the two interacting RNAs need to be
separated by the '&' character.  All lines have to be of the same length. A
secondary structure annotation has to be given in a special line with the
name 'structure'.  Base pairs are denoted in the dot-bracket notation, see
examples below.  

Interactions between the two RNAs can be denoted in the structure line only
by uppercase letters in the first file and corresponding lowercase letters on
the right side.  Additionally uppercase and lowercase letters can be used
together on one side only, see examples below.

EXAMPLE 1:
Here the interaction is denoted by 'AA' and 'aa' in the two sequences.

>seq1
ACGTAGATGCAT&GCATCAGCATA
>structure
..((..AA))..&.(((aa)))..

EXAMPLE 2:
Here the interaction is denoted by 'BB' and 'bb', whereas 'AA' and 'aa' is used
to denote a pseudoknot in the first sequence.

>seq1
ACGTAGATGCAT&GCATCAGCATA
>structure
AA{{BBaa}}..&.(((bb)))..

Command line parameters
=======================
-m NAME       Specify name of mutual information measure.
              Options are 'mi' and 'miwp'. Default is 'miwp'.
-t FILENAME   Switch to treeMI or treeMI^WP (depending on parameter -m) measure and
              specify the name of the file with the average tree distances.
							This file can be created with 'nw_avg_dist.pl'
							from a phylogenetic tree in Newick format (uses BioPerl).
-d            Debug mode
-g            Debug mode for SVG output
-v            Verbose mode, prints calculated MI values to STDERR

The script run_RILOGO_treeMI.sh can be used to calculate a tree from the input
alignment, calculate the distances and then run RILogo.  It uses fasttree for
calculating the tree, which must be installed and the path to fasttree must be
set in the script.

Output
======

RILogo outputs a single vector graphics file in SVG format, which is written to
STDOUT.  This format can be read by most vector drawing programs for
post-processing/annotating etc.

SVG files can easily converted to other file formats with common programs:
* to EPS:  inkscape -z -f in.svg -E out.eps
* to PNG:  convert in.svg out.png
	or specifying a width: inkscape --export-png=out.png --export-width=800 in.svg

Configuration
=============

RILogo can read a configuration file to customize the output.
See the default.cfg file for the customizable parameters and their
default values in RILogo.
